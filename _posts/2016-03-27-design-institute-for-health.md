Design Institute for Health

**Timeline:**

3 weeks

**Teammates:**

Britt Mottola, Stephen Webster

**Organization:**

**My Role:**

During the course of the project, I was individually responsible for creating a service blueprint outlining digital touch-points, physical interactions, and technology needs necessary to execute our solution. I also created a document detailing existing solutions the Design Institute for Health could leverage to help implement these digital tools within their limited timeframe.
